## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis phase revealed critical insights that fundamentally shaped our modeling approach and business understanding of fraudulent behavior patterns.

### 2.1. Target Variable Distribution and Class Imbalance

The analysis immediately revealed a severe class imbalance characteristic of real-world fraud detection problems. Out of 6,362,620 transactions, only 8,213 (approximately **0.129%**) are fraudulent. This extreme imbalance presents significant challenges:

1. **Model Bias Risk:** Without proper handling, models tend to achieve high accuracy by simply predicting "not fraud" for all transactions
2. **Evaluation Complexity:** Traditional accuracy metrics become misleading; precision-recall metrics become critical
3. **Sampling Strategy:** Requires sophisticated resampling techniques like SMOTE for effective model training

<img width="712" height="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52d4646b-2d8b-404e-9920-382c49701ae8" />

This finding necessitated the adoption of specialized techniques throughout the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### 2.2. Transaction Type Analysis and Fraud Distribution

A pivotal discovery emerged from analyzing fraud distribution across transaction types. Fraudulent activities are confined exclusively to **`CASH_OUT`** and **`TRANSFER`** transactions, with zero fraud instances in `CASH_IN`, `DEBIT`, or `PAYMENT` transactions.

**Business Logic Behind This Pattern:**
- **CASH_OUT:** Represents direct withdrawal of funds from the financial system
- **TRANSFER:** Enables movement of funds between accounts, facilitating money laundering
- **Other Types:** CASH_IN adds money to the system, DEBIT/PAYMENT are typically smaller, regulated transactions

<img width="872" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac6537d-1b6c-4f0e-b810-55b8e02813aa" />


This insight allows us to:
1. **Focus Model Scope:** Narrow our analysis to only fraud-relevant transaction types
2. **Business Rule Implementation:** Automatically classify other transaction types as non-fraudulent
3. **Resource Optimization:** Concentrate monitoring efforts on high-risk transaction categories

### 2.3. Comparative Fraud Rates by Transaction Type

Within the fraud-containing transaction types, significant differences in fraud rates emerged:
- **TRANSFER transactions:** Higher fraud rate per transaction
- **CASH_OUT transactions:** Lower individual fraud rate but higher absolute volume

<img width="717" height="632" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0855a3c-9935-4e0b-a220-2c2dbdc450c4" />


This suggests that fund transfers between accounts are a preferred method for sophisticated fraudsters, possibly due to:
- Higher transaction limits
- More complex audit trails
- Greater opportunities for creating shell accounts

### 2.4. Transaction Amount Analysis

The distribution analysis of transaction amounts revealed stark behavioral differences between legitimate and fraudulent transactions:

**Legitimate Transactions:**
- Concentrated at lower amounts (median around ‚Çπ75,000)
- Normal distribution with long tail
- Consistent with everyday financial activities
- 
<img width="1040" height="674" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64dca4b6-9f98-4cb7-9a55-24b46a6578bb" />


**Fraudulent Transactions:**
- Significantly higher amounts (median around ‚Çπ440,000)
- Bimodal distribution suggesting different fraud strategies
- Top 10% of fraudulent transactions exceed ‚Çπ4.5 million

**Statistical Insights:**
- 75th percentile of fraud amounts: ‚Çπ1.35 million
- 90th percentile of fraud amounts: ‚Çπ4.5 million
- Maximum fraudulent transaction: ‚Çπ92.4 million

<img width="1277" height="679" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/182ff79c-7b10-48b7-93aa-29fbd39e767c" />


This pattern aligns with the economic incentive of fraudsters: maximize value extraction per successful attack to offset the risk and effort involved in fraud execution.

### 2.5. Account Balance Behavior Analysis

#### 2.5.1. Sender Account Draining Pattern

A powerful behavioral indicator emerged when analyzing transactions that completely empty the originating account (`newbalanceOrig` = 0):

- **Normal Account Draining Rate:** ~15% of legitimate transactions
- **Fraud Account Draining Rate:** ~95% of fraudulent transactions
<img width="665" height="492" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dca4395-0c31-434d-acef-0afa89bb6f7b" />   
This dramatic difference indicates that fraudsters, once gaining access to an account, attempt to liquidate all available funds immediately to:
1. Maximize theft before detection
2. Prevent account recovery efforts
3. Minimize time exposure to security systems

#### 2.5.2. Destination Account Patterns

Fraudulent transactions show a strong preference for destination accounts with zero initial balance (`oldbalanceDest` = 0):

- **Legitimate Transactions to Zero-Balance Accounts:** ~23%
- **Fraudulent Transactions to Zero-Balance Accounts:** ~87%

 <img width="683" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d575deb9-f2e3-44e1-a335-bc7d80154dc9" />

 



This pattern strongly suggests the use of "mule accounts" - accounts created specifically to receive and quickly launder stolen funds without prior transaction history that could aid in recovery efforts.

### 2.6. System Flag Analysis

The dataset includes an `isFlaggedFraud` feature, theoretically designed to flag transfers over ‚Çπ200,000. However, detailed analysis revealed:
- Only 16 transactions flagged in the entire dataset
- Thousands of transactions meeting the criteria remained unflagged
- No correlation between flag status and actual fraud

This inconsistency led to the exclusion of this feature from our model, highlighting the importance of thorough data quality assessment in machine learning projects.

## üßπ 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline was designed to transform raw transactional data into features optimally suited for machine learning while **preserving critical fraud signals** and mitigating noise from irrelevant or misleading records.

---

### üîé 3.1. Data Filtering and Scope Reduction

* **‚úÖ Transaction Type Filtering**: Only `TRANSFER` and `CASH_OUT` transactions were retained.
* **üéØ Rationale**: 100% of fraudulent activity is confined to these types.
* **üìâ Impact**: Dataset size reduced by \~60%, with **no loss of fraud cases**.
* **üíº Business Value**: Focuses detection system on high-risk activities, improving model signal-to-noise ratio.

---

### üß© 3.2. Missing Value and Anomaly Handling

While there were no missing values per se, **domain-specific anomalies** required advanced treatment:

#### üßæ 3.2.1. Zero Balance Handling

| Feature              | Strategy                        | Reasoning                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `oldbalanceDest` = 0 | Replaced with `-1`              | Indicates **new/mule accounts** with no history                         |
| `oldbalanceOrg` = 0  | Imputed with **median balance** | Zeroes may reflect **logging errors**, not meaningful business behavior |

---

### üß† 3.3. Feature Engineering for Fraud Detection

Custom features were crafted to reveal **transactional inconsistencies**:

#### ‚öñÔ∏è 3.3.1. Origin Balance Error (`errorBalanceOrig`)

```python
errorBalanceOrig = newbalanceOrig + amount - oldbalanceOrg
```

* ‚úÖ Should equal **zero** in valid transactions
* üîç Large deviations may indicate **manipulation or data spoofing**

#### üí∞ 3.3.2. Destination Balance Error (`errorBalanceDest`)

```python
errorBalanceDest = oldbalanceDest + amount - newbalanceDest
```

* ‚úÖ Also expected to be **zero**
* üö® Discrepancies signal **interference**, hidden deductions, or **parallel transactions**

---

### ü™Ñ 3.4. Feature Selection and Dimensionality Management

#### üî¢ 3.4.1. High-Cardinality Columns Dropped

* **Dropped:** `nameOrig`, `nameDest`
* **Reason:** No predictive power; too many unique values

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3.4.2. Inconsistent Label Removal

* **Dropped:** `isFlaggedFraud`
* **Why:** Label applied inconsistently, misleading during supervised learning

#### üîÑ 3.4.3. Categorical Encoding

* **Method:** One-Hot Encoding on `type`
* **Result:** Two binary features ‚Äî `type_CASH_OUT`, `type_TRANSFER`
* **Advantage:** Allows model to learn **type-specific fraud behavior**

---

### üß™ 3.5. Data Splitting Strategy

* **Train-Test Split:** 80/20
* **Stratification:** Ensured fraud ratio (**0.129%**) is preserved in both sets
* **Temporal Assumption:** Random split valid due to **no time-based trend in fraud**
* **Train Size:** 5,090,096 transactions
* **Test Size:** 1,272,524 transactions

---

### üß¨ 3.6. Class Imbalance Handling with SMOTE

| Technique | Generates **synthetic fraud samples** using k-nearest neighbors |
| Scope     | Applied **only on training set** to avoid data leakage          |
| Goal      | Balance classes for better fraud pattern learning               |

#### üß† 3.6.2. SMOTE Benefits

1. ‚úÖ Improves model's **sensitivity to minority class**
2. üöÄ Boosts **generalization** to novel fraud behaviors
3. üéØ Enhances **recall** without sacrificing precision

#### ‚öñÔ∏è 3.6.3. Considerations & Safeguards

* **Overfitting Risk:** Controlled via **careful model regularization**
* **Synthetic Sample Quality:** Assessed via **AUPRC on original test set**
* **Business Relevance:** All synthetic cases validated against **realistic fraud profiles**

## üìä 5. Model Performance Evaluation

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5.1. Evaluation Methodology for Imbalanced Classification

In fraud detection, the **extreme class imbalance** (fraud accounts for only **0.129%** of transactions) renders traditional accuracy metrics **insufficient**. Hence, we adopted a **domain-appropriate evaluation strategy** focusing on *precision*, *recall*, *AUPRC*, and *confusion matrix analysis*.

---

### üìà 5.1.1. Primary Evaluation Metrics

#### ‚úÖ Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): **0.9979**

* **Why it matters:** Precision-Recall metrics are the **gold standard** for highly imbalanced datasets.
* **How to interpret:** Our AUPRC score is **very close to 1.0**, indicating the model rarely makes incorrect positive predictions and captures nearly all fraud cases.
* **Baseline:** A random classifier would achieve AUPRC ‚âà 0.00129.
* **üìä Visualization Tip:** Add a **Precision-Recall curve plot** comparing model vs. baseline.

#### ‚úÖ ROC-AUC Score: **0.9990**

* **Meaning:** There‚Äôs a **99.90% chance** that a randomly chosen fraud transaction will be ranked higher than a non-fraud one.
* **Limitation:** ROC-AUC can be **misleading** under class imbalance, so it complements but does not replace AUPRC.
* **üìä Visualization Tip:** Include **ROC curve** with diagonal reference (random classifier).
